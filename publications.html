									<h2><u><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11544" target="_blank">Targeted attacks on Time Series Forecasting </a></u></h2>
									<p>Real-world deep learning models developed for Time Series Forecasting are used in several critical applications ranging from medical devices to the security domain. Many previous works have shown how deep learning models are prone to adversarial attacks and studied their vulnerabilities. However, the vulnerabilities of time series models for forecasting due to adversarial inputs are not extensively explored. While the attack on a forecasting model might aim to deteriorate the performance of the model, it is more effective, if the attack is focused on a specific impact on the model's output. </p>
									<p>In this paper, we propose a novel formulation of Directional, Amplitudinal, and Temporal targeted adversarial attacks on time series forecasting models. These targeted attacks create a specific impact on the amplitude and direction of the output prediction. We use the existing adversarial attack techniques from the computer vision domain and adapt them for time series. Additionally, we propose a modified version of the Auto Projected Gradient Descent attack for targeted attacks. We examine the impact of the proposed targeted attacks versus untargeted attacks. </p>
									<p>We use KS-Tests to statistically demonstrate the impact of the attack. Our experimental results show how targeted attacks on time series models are viable and are more powerful in terms of statistical similarity. It is, hence difficult to detect through statistical methods. We believe that this work opens a new paradigm in the time series forecasting domain and represents an important consideration for developing better defenses.</p>

									<h2><u><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15920" target="_blank">Discrete Control in Real-World Driving Environments using Deep Reinforcement Learning </a></u></h2>
									<p>Training self-driving cars is often challenging since they require a vast amount of labeled data in multiple real-world contexts, which is computationally and memory intensive. Researchers often resort to driving simulators to train the agent and transfer the knowledge to a real-world setting. Since simulators lack realistic behavior, these methods are quite inefficient. </p>
									<p>To address this issue, we introduce a framework (perception, planning, and control) in a real-world driving environment that transfers the real-world environments into gaming environments by setting up a reliable Markov Decision Process (MDP). We propose variations of existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in a multi-agent setting to learn and execute the discrete control in real-world environments. </p>
									<p> Experiments show that the multi-agent setting outperforms the single-agent setting in all the scenarios. We also propose reliable initialization, data augmentation, and training techniques that enable the agents to learn and generalize to navigate in a real-world environment with minimal input video data, and with minimal training. Additionally, to show the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, we deploy our method in the virtual driving environment TORCS.</p>
